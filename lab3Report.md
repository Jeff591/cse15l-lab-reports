## Researching the less command
To recap on what the `less` command allows us to do, it allows us to view the contents of a file by displaying a porition of the file on scrren and giving us the option to scroll using the up or down arrow keys. If we want to leave the view, we just hit q.

By doing some research and looking on the following websites: (https://www.howtogeek.com/444233/how-to-use-the-less-command-on-linux/) and (https://linuxize.com/post/less-command-in-linux/), we will talk about the some commands and use them on the `./written` directory:
- `less -N <file-name>`
- `less -p<search-term> <file-name>`
- `less -s <file-name>`
- `less -X <file-name>`
