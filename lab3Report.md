      5 A Brief HistorY
      6 The early history of Nepal is a mixture of fact and myth; religious lore is associated with virtually every landmark and event. Actually, so intertwined are legend and history 
      6 that it is often impossible to determine where fact leaves off and legend begins. The prime example of this commingling of fact and fiction involves the origin of the Kathmandu      6  Valley.
      7 Legend holds that the Kathmandu Valley was once a vast lake, upon which floated a giant lotus flower, from which emanated the light of Swayambhu, the primordial Buddha. When th      7 e Tibetan god Manjushri came to view this light, he was unable to get close enough for a good look, so he took his great sword and slashed through the mountains surrounding the      7  valley to release the waters of the lake. (That is the myth. The fact, according to geologists, is that the Kathmandu Valley was indeed once a lake, though the valley<E2><80> 
      7 <99>s waters now drain through the narrow cleft of Chobar Gorge, which was most likely created by a large earthquake.)
      8 One side effect of Manjushri<E2><80><99>s draining of the lake was that the snake gods called Nagas, which lived in water, were left with no place to live. So, once again Manju      8 shri interceded and created a pond for them to live in. This pond still exists today not far from Chobar Gorge. However, elsewhere around Kathmandu, there are other stagnant po      8 nds from which rise statues of Nagas; these ponds, too, are dedicated to the snake gods.
      9 Unity and Fragmentation
     10 The Licchavi dynasty, of high-caste Hindu origin, ruled in the Kathmandu Valley from about a.d. 330 to 700. King Manadeva I (a.d. 462<E2><80><93>505) shook off the domination o     10 f the India Gupta emperors and extended his kingdom from the Kosi River in the east to the Gandaki River in the west and from the Terai to the Himalayan passes. A great king of     10  this line, Amsuvarna (609<E2><80><93>621), married his daughter Bhrikuti to the ruler of Tibet, Srongtsen Gampo. In 640, Bhrikuti and her Chinese co-wife converted Srongtsen G     10 ampo to Buddhism. Bhrikuti is venerated as the <E2><80><9C>Green Tara<E2><80><9D> and the Chinese wife as the <E2><80><9C>White Tara.<E2><80><9D> Their images are prominent in 
     10 Nepalese Buddhist art. Commercial and cultural links with Tibet, and through Tibet with China, were strengthened at this time.
     11 More reliable records come with the next major dynasty, the Malla, who were established in about 1200 by the strongman Ari Malla. The Malla came to Nepal in the first of severa     11 l waves of Hindu fugitives from the 11th-century Muslim invasion of northern India. Many of the refugees were nobles of the Chetri warrior caste from Rajasthan; forging new feu     11 dal states in Nepal, they were responsible for reinforcing Hinduism at the expense of Buddhism. The Kathmandu Valley itself was raided in 1336 by the Muslim Sultan of Bengal. I     11 n seven days he destroyed both Hindu and Buddhist temples and statues, including Swayambhunath and Pashupatinath. These great shrines were later rebuilt and expanded into their     11  present magnificence.
     12 The Malla period saw completion of Nepal<E2><80><99>s most important palaces, temples, and works of art. But Nepal and the Mallas became fragmented upon the death in 1482 of Ki     12 ng Yaksha Malla, who divided his lands amongst his heirs. For the next three centuries Nepal had three city-states side by side in the valley<C2><A0><E2><80><94><C2><A0>Kantipu     12 r (now known as Kathmandu), Lalitpur (now known as Patan), and Bhaktapur (also sometimes called Bhadgaon), along with their hinterlands.
     13 Unification
     14 Modern Nepalese history really begins with the arrival of a dynamic leader bent on unifying the country. Prithvi Narayan Shah, <E2><80><9C>The Great,<E2><80><9D> was born in 17     14 23, in the ninth generation of a line of Hindu princes of Gorkha, a hill town whose lands adjoined those of Kathmandu to the east. Like the Malla, the Shah princes had fled to 
     14 Nepal from Rajasthan rather than convert to Islam.
     15 Prithvi Narayan Shah captured Kathmandu and Patan in 1768 and Bhaktapur a year later. Before his death in 1775 he had brought under one rule all the territory from the Mahakali     15  River in the west to Sikkim and Darjeeling in the east. During the reign of his son, under a regent, the borders were pushed further north and west, provoking reactions from t     15 he Tibetans and Chinese as well as the British East India Company, the power to the south.
